        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Recipe Book is a
          community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will
          dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the
          simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over
          a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed
          brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just
          want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of
          the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, Recipe Book connects home cooks with their greatest
          sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading
          digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to
          keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no
          less.
